# Digital Heritage Workflows

## Overview
This repository documents workflows developed for architectural preservation,
heritage documentation, and spatial analysis projects.

The emphasis is on methodology, clarity of process, and scalability rather than
software-specific tricks.

## What this includes
- Documentation frameworks
- Cross-platform workflows (CAD, GIS, graphic outputs)
- Notes on decision-making and methodology
- Diagrams and visual references

## Why this matters
Clear documentation is critical to long-term stewardship of historic places.
This repository acts as a living archive of tested and evolving methods.
